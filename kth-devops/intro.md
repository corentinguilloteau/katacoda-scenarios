# Improve your commits

This tutorial aims to teach you how to improve your commits by making them more expressive and more useful, as well as
how better commits can actually help you in your CD workflow.

## Description

Git is a tool used by almost every developpers on a daily basis. While it is a very powerful tool, it is quite hard to
use correctly. Git repositories are very often used to share code between different members of a team or to the world.
Each change made to a repository comes in the form of a commit, which contains a title (and sometimes a description)
which are meant to describe what the change is.

More than often commit messages are seen as a tedious task, that developpers just skip by writing a generic message that
is not more helpful than no message at all.

But this can be fixed. In this tutorial, we will go through some tools that can help you write better commits, and
actually use it in your CD workflow.
